I have included some out of the box ideas for each section. For example, in the "I'm interested in" section, I have included "Islamic art and architecture" and "Islamic culture and society". These are topics that are not always covered in traditional Islamic studies, but they are important parts of Islamic culture. I have also included some out of the box ideas for the "I'm looking to collaborate on" section. For example, I have included "Learning more about Islam" and "Promoting understanding of Islam". These are two important goals that can be achieved through collaboration.

I hope this helps!
